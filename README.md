# tt-rss-mobilete
My own clone of [ttrss-mobile](https://github.com/mboinet/ttrss-mobile)
or Mobile Interface for [Tiny Tiny Rss](https://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki).

[See Screenshot](https://goo.gl/photos/BKvDTC4FV71cPP5X7).

# Features

* Swipe Shortcuts;
* Keyborad Shortcuts;
* Basic Plugin Support;

Code
----
I did this with two things in mind: have some fun... and learn [AngularJS](https://code.angularjs.org/) (also try [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/)).

Since this, don't expect nice code, is my first AngularJS project.

# License
Any with the [open source criteria](http://opensource.org/osd).

# Install
Clone inside your Tiny Tiny Rss server and open subdir in your browser.

I create two a cartridge for openshift [TT-RSS-Mobile-Cart](https://github.com/hugosenari/tt-rss-mobilete-cart) and [g2ttrss-mobile-cart](https://github.com/hugosenari/g2ttrss-mobile-cart) to help installation.

# TO DO
* More Settings;
* More Plugins;
* Better Interface;
* Themes;
* And other suggestions from [ttrss-mobile](https://github.com/mboinet/ttrss-mobile/issues).

# Know Bugs
* Is not a bug, your perception of world that is disturbed.

You can see common 'disturbed perceptions of world' [here](https://github.com/hugosenari/tt-rss-mobilete/issues).

I can also treat you and help you accept world as it is or exploit the Matrix to make our world looks like you want.

# NOTES
- I liked AngularJS (except for ['DI magic'](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=meme+why));
- I was expecting more from Angular Material;
